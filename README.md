Cybersecurity is more than a career path for me—it’s a passion. After building a strong foundation in networking, I’m now focused on advancing in cybersecurity through vulnerability management, cloud security, and threat detection projects.  


## ⚠️ Vulnerability Management Projects
Projects inspired by Josh Madakor’s Cyber Range — currently adapting and expanding them to showcase my own implementations.  

- **[Vulnerability Management Program Implementation](https://github.com/joshcybertest/vulnerability-management-program)** *(In Progress)*  
  Setting up a structured vulnerability management program, focusing on scanning, triage, and risk-based remediation.  

- **[Programmatic Vulnerability Remediations (PowerShell and BASH)](https://github.com/joshcybertest/programmatic-vulnerability-remediations)** *(In Progress)*  
  Automating remediation workflows with scripting to streamline patching and risk reduction.
  

## 🚨 Threat Hunting and Security Operations
Hands-on threat hunting scenarios from the Cyber Range, being expanded with my own detection and analysis notes.  

- **[Threat Hunting Scenario (Tor Browser Usage)](https://github.com/joshmadakor0/threat-hunting-scenario-tor)** *(In Progress)*  
  Investigating Tor browser usage on a network, focusing on detection methods and SIEM queries.
  

## ☁️ Cloud Security Projects
Cloud-focused labs that I’m customizing for AWS and Azure environments.  

- **[Threat Hunting Scenario (Tor Browser Usage)](https://github.com/joshmadakor0/threat-hunting-scenario-tor)** *(In Progress)*  
  Extending the Tor scenario into cloud environments to explore logging, detection, and response in cloud-native tools.
